Welcome to my interactive portfolio!
This project showcases my skills, experience, and creativity by presenting my resume and portfolio in a unique, engaging way: a mini-game!

Instead of a traditional portfolio, I’ve added a layer of interactivity and fun to make exploring my work more engaging.
Here’s how it works:

• Move the character around: Navigate the game world to discover different sections of my portfolio.

• Interactive elements: Walk up to objects or areas to view my resume, experience, projects, and more!

This is more than just a portfolio—it's a creative way to demonstrate my coding skills and passion for game design.
